dice

There are also six array elements called 'die[]'. The script initializes the 'die' as:

die[1]="⚀"
die[2]="⚁"
die[3]="⚂"
die[4]="⚃"
die[5]="⚄"
die[6]="⚅"

These are a graphical representation of the individual die. We generate them using UTF-8 symbols. We make them, in Linux, using CTRL+SHIFT+U to generate a 'u' on the screen. Then type in the UTF-8 code and press Enter. The characters should change into the character of the specific die. The codes are as follows:

⚀ - 2680
⚁ - 2681
⚂ - 2682
⚃ - 2683
⚄ - 2684
⚅ - 2685
